# ive spent just over a thousand days in los angeles
i cant resist the urge to look back and notice
what’s hidden and what’s revealed
i observe the same pattern of conditional reminiscence that crushed me once
how can you know what someone is really like before taking the time to get to know what someone is really like. when i move into a certain position, i can feel my heart moving in my chest
once the mirroring is covered and the doormat is picked up
when individuals are apart, they may idealize each other
today i thought “why even ask me if you’re going to do it anyway” and then i read it.
i can’t help but 
  wonder until it happens to me too
i wonder if i can make it happen faster this time

i’d do anything to escape my cubicle
