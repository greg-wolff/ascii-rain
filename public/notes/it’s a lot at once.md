# it’s a lot at once
## reverence. i can toughen up. i’m not afraid to become, close, similar, the same. it’s only for a moment, anyway, you still have to tell me about tony sometime. did i tell her i too? probably. bewilderment? hardly. maybe, parasocial? but still i don’t know what 333 means to you. supposedly nothing during the celica era. the truth is: there is no universal oneness that can be perceived in this world, it’s like the flatlander jumping a mobius strip. in particular, now, wait, um, how did that just play... ineffability, i won’t question it. besides, “there are no synchronicities” more on apophenia later. quite a critic for a supposed clairvoyant “like minds attract one another”. it is possible, i concluded, not by way of extrasensory perception, but simply through well adjusted judgment. shuffling my entire yearly playlist and two girls kissing plays
